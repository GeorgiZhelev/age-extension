# Age Counter New Tab

A Firefox extension that replaces your new tab page with a customized dashboard featuring:

- **Age Counter**: Display your age with precise decimal counting
- **Calendar & Time**: Current date, day of week, and time
- **Todo List**: Manage your tasks
- **Most Visited Sites**: Quick access to your 30 most frequently visited websites
